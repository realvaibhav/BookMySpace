# Book my Space

## Introduction
Book My Space is a web application for online vehicle parking slot booking and its management. It is a web based platform where people can just search for the area, address they are going and want a parking spot to park their vehicle and get results of all parking lots within a radius and they can book a spot in any one of them based on their
availability and users choice for distance, price, duration, time, date. Any parking lot manager/owner will be able to register their parking lot and automate the current manual effort of booking, payments, and management of parking spots.

## Types of Users
 - **Customer**:  the ones who are looking to book a spot, they will enter the address and all the parking lots in that area will be listed with spot availability and charges, reviews, ratings, timings, they can choose any one, sort results by price, ratings and book a spot for any time.
 - **Parking Lot Managers**: those users who own a parking lot can signup and register their parking lot on the platform (by filling the details such as booking price, no of spots in the parking lot, timings) and then they can manage all the bookings, billings etc by logging IN in their account. 
 - **Platform Admin**:  a system admin who can see all the details no of bookings month wise, total transaction flow, and manage all the users, their details etc. There is also some addition features such as any user can change their passwords, sms & email alerts of bookings, add to favorites, write review, view on google maps.
